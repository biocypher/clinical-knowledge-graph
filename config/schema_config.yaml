Title: BioCypher graph schema configuration file

# This configuration file establishes the hierarchy and connectivity in a newly
# set-up BioCypher property graph database. Naming should adhere to Biolink
# nomenclature (available at https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/ or via 
# the python module 'biolink-model-toolkit').

# The BioCypher YAML file specifies only the leaves of the hierarchy tree of
# the desired graph; the hierarchical structure of entities will be derived 
# from the Biolink model. Thus, only the immediate constituents of the graph
# need to be specified in the schema config.


# ---
# "Named Things"
# ---
# The implementation of named things is fairly straightforward, since they are
# usually represented in node form, which is also the Biolink recommendation.
# The same is not true for associations.
#
# A little more complex is the representation of aggregates of named things, 
# for instance in the case of functional protein complexes. These are represented
# by so-called "mixins", which are not officially part of the hierarchy.

# ---
# Associations
# ---
# Associations are not supposed to be represented in node form as per the 
# specifications of Biolink. However, in an analytic context, it often makes 
# sense to represent interactions as nodes in Neo4j, because it enables, for
# instance, the annotation of a relationship with a publication as source of
# evidence (also known as reification in the knowledge graph world). 

# The Biolink specifications for these types of relationships do 
# not go into depth; for example, the hierarchy for molecular interactions
# (ie, "associations") ends at "PairwiseMolecularInteraction", there are no 
# explicit terms for protein-protein-interaction, phosphorylation, miRNA-
# targeting, etc. Biolink proposes to use interaction identifiers from 
# ontologies, such as https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/.
